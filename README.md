## Introduction

* A minimal example of a full flow - Train a model, save a model, optimize the saved model with TensorRT
* Tensorflow used 1.14

## Readme

To run tensorboard and see the model
> tensorboard --logdir xor_010

To run inference
1. Run the cells in note_010_load_signature.ipynb

To run TensorRT optimization and inference
1. Run the cells in tensorrt_inference.ipynb

To re-run the model training from scratch
Run the cells at note_010_save_signature.ipynb

## Steps sequence

* note_010_save_signature.ipynb
* note_010_load_signature.ipynb    // Benchmark without optimization
* tensorrt_inference.ipynb  	 // Benchmark with optimization
